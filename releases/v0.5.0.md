# Formulate 0.5.0

![All Formulate Field Types](/images/releases/0.5.0/all-field-types.png)

This is the biggest update to Formulate to date.
Be mindful that it includes a number of breaking changes, so you may need to address some compilation errors after upgrading.
The highlights include:

* 7 new types of fields.
* Custom fields are more upgrade friendly.
* The layout designer is easier to use for larger layouts.
* Data values are more flexible.

## New Field Types
These new types of fields were added:

* Radio Button List
* Extended Radio Button List
* Checkbox List
* Date
* Hidden
* Header
* Rich Text

## Field Enhancements
These changes were made to fields:

* **Query String Field Values**. Allowed field values to be set via a query string with a key matching the field's alias.
* **Pluggable Fields**. Made fields pluggable to avoid having to modify Formulate's core JavaScript.
* **Field Formatting**. Added ability to format values, which can be useful for better presentation in emails.
* **Button Types**. Allows for configurable button types (e.g., previous, next, submit).
* **Conditional Fields**. Added support for fields that show based on the value of another field (i.e., condition fields). Currently, this must be configured manually by a developer by editing the form template.
* **Upload Validation**. Add support for validations to upload field. You can now mark a file upload as required.

## Layout Designer Changes
These changes were made to the layout designer:

* **Unused Fields**. Added support for unused fields, so you can exclude some fields from a given layout.

## Frontend Improvements
These changes were made to the frontend of the form:

* **Validation Scroll**. Scroll to first invalid input after failed submission, which makes it easier for the user to find their mistake.

## Data Value Changes
These changes were made to data values:

* **String Pairs**. Added a data value that stores a list of string pairs. Useful when you want the value to be different than the label.
* **More States**. Added inhabited territories and a federal district (i.e., Washington DC) to the built-in list of US states.

## Submission Handler Changes
Allowed submissions handlers to have a synchronous method for when they need to extract information from the same thread as the submission.

## API Improvements
Made a few classes public that are useful when creating custom fields.

## Informational Changes
Added banner so people are less confused about the unimplemented data sources feature.

## Fixes
Ensured Formulate icons don't overwrite Umbraco's built-in icons.
